Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (GBD 2016) Socio-demographic Index (SDI) 1970–2016

The Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (GBD 2016), coordinated by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), estimated the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors for 195 countries and territories and at the subnational level for a subset of countries.

Developed by GBD researchers and used to help produce these estimates, the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) is a summary measure of a geography's socio-demographic development. It is based on average income per person, educational attainment, and total fertility rate (TFR). SDI contains an interpretable scale: zero represents the lowest income per capita, lowest educational attainment, and highest TFR observed across all GBD geographies from 1970 to 2016, and one represents the highest income per capita, highest educational attainment, and lowest TFR. This dataset provides tables with SDI values for all estimated GBD 2016 geographies for 1970–2016 and groupings by geography based on 2016 values.
