Global Development Assistance for Health, Government, Prepaid Private, and Out-of-Pocket Health Spending 1995-2014

Research by the Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network produced retrospective national health spending estimates for 1995-2014 for 184 countries. The estimates cover total health spending, and health spending disaggregated by source into government spending, out-of-pocket, prepaid private, and development assistance for health. National health spending by source, including development assistance for health, was estimated based on a diverse set of data, including program reports, budget data, national estimates, and 964 National Health Accounts. The resulting estimates were used to help produce forecasted health spending estimates for 2015-2040. Results of the study were published in The Lancet in April 2017 in "Evolution and patterns of global health financing 1995–2014: development assistance for health, and government, prepaid private, and out-of-pocket health spending in 184 countries."
