### Re-use note from Ian Kirkman (ikirkman@uw.edu):

To limit the file size for github upload, I restricted the data to years 2014-2016. This was done via filtering the year_id column in Excel. This data restriction has no impact on the project code, which is built to run on the full IHME dataset.



### Original GHDx Readme notes:

Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (GBD 2016) Population Estimates 1950-2016

The Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (GBD 2016), coordinated by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), estimated the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors for 195 countries and territories and at the subnational level for a subset of countries.

This dataset provides population estimates by location, age, and sex for 1950-2016. Data sources used to produce these estimates include World Population Prospects: 2015 Revision, from the United Nations Population Division, and the WHO Human Mortality Database.
